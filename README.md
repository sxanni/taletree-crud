# TALE TREE [Your story begins here]

Tale tree is a social media app centerd around story telling.

It involves bringing users together by having them collaborate on a story through threaded posts.

Each user gets a limited amount of words to tell a story and has the ability to start a story and add to another persons story with permission.

The best stories are featured on a trending stories page.

The person who starts a story is the root and their followers or “flowers” are allowed to add to the story.
